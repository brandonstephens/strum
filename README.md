## ♿️ Accessibility

- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstrum.bsteph.com)
- [Web accessibility evaluation tool](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://strum.bsteph.com)

**Note on viewport**  
To get 100% on accessibility under the Lighthouse metric you need to update the `viewport` meta tag to be:

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5" />
```

I've chosen not to do this as it causes the site to zoom in frequently while tapping the UI.

**Note on colors**  
Special care was taken to pick colors that worked well for various forms of color blindness. [xScope](https://xscopeapp.com) was used to preview colors using the loupe tool.
